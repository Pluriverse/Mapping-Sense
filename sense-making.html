        <h2>Sens/e making, what does it all mean?</h2> <br><br>
        <p>Translation within performative Arts Based Research and Hermeneutics embraces poiesis, or ‘knowing by making’ (Gerber & Myers-Coffman, 2017, p.591). Translation is not a singular event, but rather this sense of knowing is constantly emerging, created and recreated in a relational and intersubjective process (Green, 2022a). We sit with/in the data and embrace Deleuze's concept of ‘becoming’, the idea that nothing is a singular definable thing, but a network of interconnected processes at various stages of change (Stagoll, 2010).<br><br>
            Knowledge becomes accessible through a process of thematic analysis and artistic response during which we are asked to describe what is given to us in the immediate experience without being ‘obstructed by pre-conceptions and theoretical notions’ (Kafle, 2013, p.189). We make sens/e (direction) of what our research is telling us while still honouring the expansiveness of the arts/arts making process. I would liken this process of arts based translation to Donna Haraway’s idea of ‘undoing’, acknowledging that both researcher and data/co-researchers are coming out of the process differently to how one started (Yale University, 2017). <br><br>
            This form of undoing illuminates what is present within the texts and our physical senses rather than seeking out a definitive Truth (Green, 2022a). We aim to provoke the data and answer the question, what does it all mean? The process is similar to that of a therapeutic session wherein the task is not to describe what is in front of us but rather illuminate its essence and then consider how this may be understood in an everyday setting. <br><br>
            Sens/e making is essential. It gives a voice to our data, enables our research to have traction with others and drives critical conversation (Kapitan, 2018). It makes new knowledge accessible, and enhances our abilities as therapists to support clients in translating the data of their own stories. Furthermore, by adding our voice to the wider conversation we are enriching an available body of research, assisting in theory building and enhancing/advancing the profession of Creative Arts Therapy (Gerber & Myers-Coffman, 2017 & Gerber et al., 2012). Reid (2020) adds that through the process of translation our ‘biases and blindspots become transparent’, an essential skill of both facilitating therapy and hermeneutic research. <br><br>
            This process of gentle sens/e making through arts based practices disrupts western academic structures shifting the research relationship from subject-object to subject-subject. Further following this process is celebrating what Sabbagh recognises as an ‘active valuing of experience and the coexistence of multiple truths’(2022 p.1), empowering both me and my research companions; the material/mater/land. It feels both authentic and fundamental to my goal of producing socially relevant research, democratising information and ultimately contributing to the localisation of  arts therapy practices in Aotearoa, New Zealand.<br><br>
