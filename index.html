        <p>Stepping slowly in relationship with the material/mater/land, 
            we are (deep) in sens/e making. <br>
            Together we adopt the notion of a  hīkoi, a ‘traditional form of walking and talking with the land and exhuming meaning’ (Marques et al., 2018, p.2). <br>
            Follow the path and relish in the (felt sense) of interconnectedness and not knowing.<br>
            <br>
            Tread softly, taking in each step, allow possibility to rise.<br>
            Grant yourself permission to pause or return back as you need,<br> 
            eventually you will find your end.<br>
            Witness here what surrounds you.<br>
